# ðŸ”¢ 100Devs Push Project001: Calculator

## Description
A simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Features
- Clickable buttons for numbers and operators
- Prevents multiple decimals in a number
- Allows negative numbers (must enter `-` as the first input)
- Prevents inputting multiple operators in a row (last entered operator overwrites others)
- Evaluates expressions with correct order of operations
- Automatically resizes font to fit results on the display
- Clear button to reset everything
- Refactored to use classes for better organization and use of OOP principles

## How It Works
- Calculator class creates a calculator that stores numbers and operators in an array as you click on the web interface 
- Evaluator class is instantiated when `"="` is clicked to evaluate the expression array
- Evaluator loops through array searching for operators and executing them according to mathematical order of operations
- The result is displayed on screen, font size adjusts automatically if needed to fit in the results window
